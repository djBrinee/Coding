# **Testing concepts**
## **What is pytest**?
Pytest is a framework for automated unit testing. Framework used to test this program by units (specific functional parts of the code).
## **Why pytest**
Pytest let the developer to write small and readable test. In addition, it can be very useful to test complex functions with few code lines.
## **Pytest example**
It let the developer test functions, and it its very efficient because you can see the expected result and compare it with the real result through the integrated architecture component: assert. Here is an example of a unit test using pytest.
```
#Define the function to test
---------------------------------
def multiplication(x, y):
    return x * y
---------------------------------
#Test the answer giving the parameters
def test_ multiplication ():

    assert multiplication(3, 2) == 6
---------------------------------
## If 3 * 2 is 6, return true; else it return false and the real result.
```
